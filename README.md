**How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?**

The key to writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable is simply following industry standard practices, particularly regarding notation. If you do this, it will be easy for any future engineer to understand how your program works, which also makes it adaptable. The advantage of this project, and of using a dashboard widget to connect to a database, is that it limits the need for interaction with the database, and allows for many changes to be made through the dashboard.

**How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?**

I approach all projects in a similar way; a top-down analysis of the desired end result of the program. I assess the high level functions of the project, and then break each of those function down into smaller and smaller subsequent increments until the smallest workable task is listed. In this particular project, breaking up the project into 3 main segments of database/mongo work, Core Python code, and .ipynb file/dashboard was the first step. I was then able to break down the needs of each of those three high-level tasks into executable goals.

**What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?**

Computer scientists are part of nearly everything in our daily lives; behind every internet connected device, and most electroic devices, there is a computer scientists making that thing work or continue to work. Every device, into which we willingly submit our personal information, is secured by code written by an engineer. The most important thing a computer scientist can do is be proactive about security measures, and follow industry standard best practices dilligently. The work of a computer scientists is invaluable to any company these days; Whether it is by maintaining a database that helps to organize a companies data, or by creating and maintaining web interfaces that allow customers/employees/vendors/etc. to interact with a company.
